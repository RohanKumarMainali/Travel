              <h1>Everest Base Camp Difficulty </h1>
              <p>
                Travel experts of Nepal have graded the difficulty of the
                Everest Base Camp trek as “moderate”. This means you will need
                very good fitness for walking 6 to 7 hours each day for about a
                week. However, there’s no need for any mountain climbing skills
                and gears to complete this trek. Basically, any person with good
                physical and mental fitness can complete this trek with a few
                months of preparation. Two to three months before the trek, you
                need to engage in some cardio exercises such as running,
                jogging, swimming, and cycling. It really helps to boost your
                stamina before you head for the trek. It’s easier than the
                Everest Three Pass Trek. The major Everest base camp trek
                difficulty is distance and altitude. Everest Base Camp distance
                is about 150 km and you will be covering this distance for 8
                days. This means you will be walking 15 to 20 km each day. This
                makes 6 to 7 hours of the daily walk which surely demands good
                physical health. Along with distance, the altitude of Everest
                base camp 5300 M, and that of Kala Pathar is also a big
                challenge during the trek. Once you cross Namche Bazaar, you
                start to feel the pressure of low oxygen level which makes your
                climb harder. Covering 500 to 1000m each day and including a
                rest day in Everest Base Camp Trek Itinerary helps you a lot.
                However, this doesn’t mean you need oxygen for the Everest Base
                Camp trek.
