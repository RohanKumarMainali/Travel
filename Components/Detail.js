                                Travel experts of Nepal have graded the difficulty of the Everest Base Camp trek as “moderate”. This means you will need very good fitness for walking 6 to 7 hours each day for about a week. However, there’s no need for any mountain climbing skills and gears to complete this trek. Basically, any person with good physical and mental fitness can complete this trek with a few months of preparation. Two to three months before the trek, you need to engage in some cardio exercises such as running, jogging, swimming, and cycling. It really helps to boost your stamina before you head for the trek. It’s easier than the Everest Three Pass Trek.

                                The major Everest base camp trek difficulty is distance and altitude. Everest Base Camp distance is about 150 km and you will be covering this distance for 8 days. This means you will be walking 15 to 20 km each day. This makes 6 to 7 hours of the daily walk which surely demands good physical health. Along with distance, the altitude of Everest base camp 5300 M, and that of Kala Pathar is also a big challenge during the trek. Once you cross Namche Bazaar, you start to feel the pressure of low oxygen level which makes your climb harder. Covering 500 to 1000m each day and including a rest day in Everest Base Camp Trek Itinerary helps you a lot. However, this doesn’t mean you need oxygen for the Everest Base Camp trek.
